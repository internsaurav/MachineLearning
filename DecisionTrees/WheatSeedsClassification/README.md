About the dataset: <ol>
	<li>To construct the data, seven geometric parameters of grains: area A [ mm 2 ] , perimeter P [ m ] , compactness C = 4Ï€A / P^2 , length of kernel [ mm ] , width of kernel [ mm ] , asymmetry coefficient and length of kernel groove [ mm ] were measured from a total of 210 samples</li>
	<li>All samples are labeled by numbers: 1-70 for the Kama wheat variety, 71-140
for the Rosa wheat variety, and 141-210 for the Canadian wheat variety </li></ol>

Classification Algorithm used: Scikit-learn decision tree classifier <br />
